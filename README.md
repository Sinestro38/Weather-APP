# Weather-APP
This is my first legit project on JS. It took me 3.5 hrs, don't laugh ;).

By coding this web app, I learned how to use classes, async await, the fetch api, local storage, and generally how to decentralize my js files to make it more organized.

If you're reading this right now, I have no idea how you ended up in such a remote repo of github. But I appreciate you looking through!
